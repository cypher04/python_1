# function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. In python, identation with tabs or spaces is what is used

def samehi(name):
    print(f'hello {name}')
samehi('igol')

# return values
numb1 = 87; numb2 = 22
def getSum():
    total = numb1 + numb2
    return total
getSum()

print(getSum())
